# Indie Developer Games Review Website – Requirements Specification Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the architecture, technology stack, development standards, and best practices for the Indie Developer Games Review Website. Inspired by platforms like Indie Game Reviewer, the site will feature dedicated sections for Reviews, News, Previews, Developer Interviews, and static pages such as About and Contact. The site is built with Next.js and emphasizes TypeScript for robust type-safety and maintainability. Dynamic content is managed via a headless CMS (e.g., Contentful, Sanity, or Strapi), integrated through Next.js API routes for backend operations.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Architecture

**Frontend & Server-Side Rendering:**

- **Framework:** Built with Next.js using TypeScript.
- **Rendering:** Employs Next.js hybrid rendering—static generation with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for performance, complemented by server-side rendering for dynamic content.

**Backend & API Routes:**

- Implements Next.js API routes to handle dynamic operations (e.g., content fetching, authentication, and business logic).
- Integrates a headless CMS to manage articles, reviews, developer interviews, and static content with API calls.

**Content Management & Search:**

- Content is organized into structured types (articles, reviews, interviews) and fetched either at build time or on demand via ISR.
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities will be implemented using tools such as Algolia or ElasticSearch.

### 2.2 Technology Stack

**Client & Server Framework:**

- **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript for seamless client-server integration.
- **Styling:** HTML5 and CSS3 with SASS for modular, maintainable design.

**Routing & Data Fetching:**

- Leverages Next.js file-based routing to support both static pages (e.g., About, Contact) and dynamic pages (e.g., Post and Category pages).
- Uses Next.js functions (e.g., `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, `getServerSideProps`) for efficient content fetching from the CMS.

**State Management:**

- Managed via the React Context API for global state.

**Testing:**

- Incorporates Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
- Uses Axe and Lighthouse for accessibility testing.

**Version Control & CI/CD:**

- Code is hosted on GitHub.
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions run linting, TypeScript type-checking, and tests on every commit and deployment.

**Deployment:**

- The site will be deployed on platforms like Vercel, leveraging Next.js capabilities for scalability and performance.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 TypeScript Integration

- **Strong Typing:** All components, API routes, and services must use explicit TypeScript interfaces and types.
- **Utility Types:** Utilize TypeScript utilities (e.g., Partial, Pick, Readonly) consistently.
- **Code Conventions:** All JavaScript files are migrated to `.ts` or `.tsx` files and must comply with a strict `tsconfig.json`.

### 3.2 Content Organization & Navigation

- **Dynamic Content Modules:**
  - **Homepage:** Showcases featured articles, news sliders, and segmented sections (Reviews, News, Interviews).
  - **Category Pages:** Dynamically filter content by type with pagination and sorting.
  - **Post Pages:** Dedicated pages for each review, news article, or interview, featuring full content, metadata, comments, and social sharing options.
- **Static Pages:** Includes About and Contact pages to detail site mission, the editorial team, and contact information.
- **User Roles & Authoring:**
  - Implements role-based access control for different user types (e.g., reviewer, editor, admin).
  - Integrates with the headless CMS to enable secure workflows for drafting, approving, and publishing content.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance, Accessibility, & Usability

- **Performance:**
  - Utilize Next.js’s static generation and ISR.
  - Implement lazy loading for media and adopt code splitting.
  - Employ caching strategies with SWR or client-side caching.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Adhere to WCAG 2.1 standards (keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, etc.).
  - Regularly validate accessibility with tools like Lighthouse and Axe.
- **Usability:**
  - Enhance navigation with breadcrumb trails, robust category menus, and logical internal linking.

### 4.2 SEO and Analytics

- **SEO Optimization:**
  - Use semantic HTML5, structured metadata, JSON‑LD, and descriptive URLs.
  - Utilize Next.js’ Head component for managing meta tags.
- **Analytics & Monitoring:**
  - Integrate custom tracking events (such as article shares and click interactions) via Google Analytics.
  - Monitor performance and errors using Sentry, with alerts configured through the CI/CD pipeline.

### 4.3 Scalability, Security, & Internationalization

- **Scalability:**
  - Adopt caching mechanisms and leverage CDNs for high traffic management.
  - Define robust backup and recovery strategies for CMS-managed content.
- **Security:**
  - Secure API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization workflows.
  - Implement cookie consent banners and maintain privacy policies for GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations.
- **Internationalization:**
  - Prepare for multilingual support using Next.js built‑in i18n routing and libraries like next‑i18next.
  - Ensure locale-specific handling (languages, date formats, currencies) is in place.

## 5. Development, Testing, and Deployment

### 5.1 CI/CD Pipeline

- Use GitHub Actions to run linting, TypeScript type-checking, tests, and to deploy across development, staging, and production environments.

### 5.2 Testing & Accessibility

- Utilize Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing.
- Integrate accessibility tools (Axe and Lighthouse) into the CI/CD process to ensure compliance with standards.

### 5.3 Documentation & Coding Standards

- Maintain thorough inline documentation and generate API reference guides using tools like TypeDoc.
- Establish clear contribution guidelines and adhere to comprehensive coding standards.

### 5.4 Error Pages

- Design and deploy custom error pages for:
  - `404 Not Found`
  - `500 Internal Server Error`
  - `403 Forbidden`

## 6. Recommended File Structure
