# Indie Developer Games Review Website â€“ Requirements Specification Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the architecture, technology stack, development standards, and best practices for the Indie Developer Games Review Website. The site features a unique Game Boy-inspired design while maintaining modern web standards, built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript for robust type-safety and maintainability.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Rendering:**
- Next.js 14 with App Router for modern React patterns
- Server Components for improved performance
- Client Components for interactive features
- Hybrid rendering strategy:
  - Static Generation (SSG) for static content
  - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for dynamic content
  - Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for personalized content

**UI/UX Components:**
- Custom UI components built with Radix UI primitives
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Dark mode support with custom color schemes

**State Management:**
- React Context API for global state
- React Query for server state management
- Local storage for user preferences
- URL-based state for shareable views

### 2.2 Backend Architecture

**API Layer:**
- Next.js API Routes for backend operations
- RESTful API design principles
- Rate limiting and request validation
- Error handling middleware

**Database:**
- MongoDB Atlas for data storage
- Mongoose for data modeling
- Indexed queries for performance
- Data validation with Zod schemas

**Authentication:**
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- JWT for session management
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- Role-based access control

### 2.3 Content Management

**Content Structure:**
- Reviews with ratings and categories
- News articles with rich text
- Developer interviews
- User-generated content
- Media assets (images, videos)

**Content Operations:**
- CRUD operations via API
- Content versioning
- Draft/publish workflow
- Media optimization

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 TypeScript Implementation
